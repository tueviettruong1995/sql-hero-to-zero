 - "Group by" is needed to have all original columns/ attributes presented in Select clause of the query

-- Having clause --
/* Where condition vs Having clause
- Both "Where condtion" and "Having clause" used to filtering rows in data
- "Having claused" can be used with aggregate functions and group by only.
- A "Where condition" is not required to have group by within the query

- we can use mathematical expression directly in selection query
- built-in functions like count, min, max , etc. require Group by to run

/*  =================== Case When
Case-when is a conditional function. It is used when we want create new labels for values
  
select * from public.incomegroup;
*/



/* =================== Union vs Join
- JOIN combines data from multiple different tables, whereas UNION combines data from multiple similar tables.
- JOIN appends the output horizontally, whereas UNION combines the result
*/

/* ============================ Select data from multiple tables with join
In Join function:
- a table can join not only others table but also itselft
- tables are joined by pairs and by multiple keys.
*/


/*Alias for attributes and tables
It is inefficiency when we re-write out table phrase again and again. Mistakes, errors can be happend and it is hard to read or revise the codes. 
A solution is that we can set abbreviation/ alias for  used table.
- easiness to select columns form different table
- Avoid select duplicated columns form different tables
- easiness to read code
