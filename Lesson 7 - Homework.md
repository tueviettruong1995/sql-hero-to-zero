# Lesson 7:  Working with NoSQL Database
## Homework

Run the following queries in Mongo DB:
1.	Create a database having name chosen by yourself
2.	Import the earthquake week , day , and hour  datasets into your instance of Mongo.<br>
__dataset: Lecture 8 _ Homework_dataset.zip__

3.	Show all the collections in your database.
4.	Show all earthquakes in each collection.
5.	Show the time, depth, place, and latitude (don't show the ID field) for each earthquake from the week collection.
6.	Show documents from the week collection where their latitude is higher than 60.
7.	Show the time, depth, place, and latitude (don't show the ID field) for each earthquake from the week collection where their latitude is higher than 60. Sort in ascending order by latitude.
8.	Show the time, longitude, latitude, magType, and mag for each earthquake from the week collection where their magType equals ml.
9.	Show all documents where the earthquake occurred in Alaska (place).
10.	Show the total number of documents where the earthquake from the week collection occurred in Alaska (place).
11.	Show earthquakes from the week collection where their magType equals ml and their depth was greater than 20.
12.	Show earthquakes from the week collection where their magType equals ml and their depth was greater than 20. Sort by depth in descending order.
13.	Show the most significant (depth) earthquake from your day collection.
14.	Remove all documents from your earthquake hour collection where net is "nc".
15.	Remove your earthquake hour collection from the database.
16.	Remove your database from MongoDB.
